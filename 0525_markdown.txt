### Hybrid D₂ Unifies DFA ToE
   Protein D₂ analysis shows 5O3L PHF (~2.4) as stable and 2MXU amyloid-β (~1.25) as collapsed, aligning with IceCube’s coupled (>1.49) and collapse (~1.46) zones. Hybrid metrics, designed for civilizational predictors, are deferred to larger systems, unifying neutrino, TEO (456/k), and protein dynamics (Babel-like).
