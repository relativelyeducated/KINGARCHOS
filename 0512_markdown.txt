### Hybrid D₂ Unifies DFA ToE
   Enhanced analysis shows 5O3L PHF (D₂~2.4, low HHI) as stable, contrasting synthetic amyloid (D₂=1.25, high HHI), aligning with IceCube’s coupled (>1.49) and collapse (~1.46) zones. Pending 2MXU validation, this unifies neutrino, TEO (456/k), and protein dynamics, reflecting universal self-regulation (Babel-like).
